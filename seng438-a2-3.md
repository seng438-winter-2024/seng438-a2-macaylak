# 1 Introduction
In this lab assignment, our main goal is to explore the fundamentals of automated unit testing, with a specific focus on crafting tests tailored to the distinct requirements of each unit. JUnit, an integral part of the XUnit framework family and a widely used unit testing framework for Java, takes center stage as our primary tool. By the end of this lab, we aim to empower ourselves to create automated test code proficiently using JUnit and other XUnit frameworks, such as NUnit. Additionally, we will learn to seamlessly integrate and work with mock objects in the development of our test code.

It's important to note that this lab is a collaborative effort, meant to be completed as a group. Together, we will navigate through three key sections. The initial phase is designed to familiarize ourselves with the essential concepts. We'll then transition to the creation of unit tests based on the requirements outlined in Javadocs. Finally, the testing journey concludes with the execution of the test suites on various versions of the system under scrutiny, with a meticulous collection of the results.

The tools at our disposal for this lab are JUnit and Javadoc. JUnit, being a popular and free unit testing tool for Java, provides a robust framework for our testing endeavors. Javadoc, on the other hand, serves as the format for storing requirement specifications, aiding in the generation of comprehensive test suites.
