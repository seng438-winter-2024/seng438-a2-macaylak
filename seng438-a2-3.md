# 1 Introduction

Automated unit testing is vital in software development, ensuring code reliability and correctness. In this lab, we focus on mastering automated testing using JUnit, a popular framework for Java. The aim is to equip students with skills to create automated test code and work with mock objects effectively, enhancing software quality.

This lab emphasizes group collaboration to facilitate learning. Divided into three sections, it guides students from familiarization with testing tools to creating comprehensive test suites based on Javadoc specifications. Using JFreeChart as our system under test, we'll apply these concepts practically, ensuring a solid understanding of automated unit testing principles.
